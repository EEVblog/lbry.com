Protocol engineers are responsible for building and maintaining the code that powers the LBRY network. 

Protocol work involves deeply technical things like networking (DHT, TCP, UDP), databases (key-value and SQL), filesystems. 
It also involves maintaining an open-source project: communicating clearly in writing, reviewing code contributions, and 
interacting with the wider LBRY community. You can be a great protocol engineer by excelling at either half of the equation or by showing a strong ability to bridge the two halves.

The [primary codebase](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) is currently in Python, but we're migrating to Go. 
Experience with either language, or with blockchain or peer-to-peer technology, is beneficial but not required.
