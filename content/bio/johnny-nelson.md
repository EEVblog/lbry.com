Johnny thinks a lot about how attention works on the internet. Having started programming in elementary 
school, he became infatuated with how we communicate with and through computers. Eventually, he did 
a Ph.D. studying belief systems computationally. Immediately afterwards he left academia, intent on 
putting what he learned into practice.

Johnny cares about the systems we inhabit -- how they allow us to exchange ideas and find each other. 
In short, he's motivated by the premise that we can "engineer the noosphere." The internet and 
everything after is still in early development! Given that he believes censorship-resistance is a 
long-term evolutionary pressure, it doesn't make sense to work on a platform that doesn't treat it as a given.
